# oop-lab-2
 
**Oop-lab-2** is a Qt-based program for analyzing properties of sorting algorithms. Current features include:

* Multiple sorting algorithms, including some with configurable parameters (e.g. Shellsort with multiple "gapping strategies") 
  * Пащенко Дмитро (@ozzwoy) - see README [here](https://github.com/WAG13/oop-lab-2/tree/master/oop-lab-2/SortingAlgorithms).
* Tracking time and memory usage with an easy to use TestBuilder
  * Грищенко Юрій (@gardenappl) - see README [here](https://github.com/WAG13/oop-lab-2/tree/master/oop-lab-2/Diagnostics)
* Approximation algorithms utilising the Armadillo library. This allows us to determine time and space complexity.
  * Пупов Нікіта (@Nikitosis) - see README [here](https://github.com/WAG13/oop-lab-2/tree/master/oop-lab-2/Approximation)
* UI with time and memory usage plots.
  * Бондарець Дарина (@WAG13)
* More features coming soon.

Tested on GCC and MinGW. To build on Linux, you must have OpenBLAS and Laplack installed. Windows libraries are all included in this repository.

Includes unit tests written with Qt Test.
